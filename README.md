## Whats new in Spring 5

Spring 5 adds a plenty of new features. Following are my favourits:
- Reactive Programming Model
- Spring Web Flux
- Reactive DB repositories & integrations + hot event streaming: MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, Kafka
- Testing improvements â€“ WebTestClient (based on reactive WebFlux WebClient)
- JDK 8+ and Java EE 7+ baseline - see the `reactive-quotes` demo for Java 9 example
- Kotlin functional DSL
